# Whoami
My name is Zero (or Z3r0 or UserZ3r0 or whatever you want). I'm a infosec student and sometimes i hack things. 
I always try to learn new things, gain new knowledge, and share them to others. Iâ€™m very interested in the field of penetration testing and hardware / RF hacking.

## What's the purpose of this ?

This place is where i'm going to publish my researchs, projects or either other things (like video games hacking)
I want to share with some people my work.
